# hackathon-2021-day1

The Day 1 Guided Tutorial was led by [Christina Hedges](https://github.com/christinahedges), walking through the basics of using git and GitHub for version control and collaborative coding. Her complete materials for that tutorial (and more on other topics) are available in [her incredibly useful Astronomy Workflow page](https://christinahedges.github.io/astronomy_workflow/notebooks/1.0-basics/git-basics.html).
